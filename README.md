## Grid_world_using_reinforcement

## Introduction

Project explores the Grid World problem using reinforcement learning techniques. In this environment, an agent navigates a grid to achieve a goal while learning optimal strategies through interaction with the environment. By employing algorithms such as Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), the agent learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time. This project demonstrates key concepts in reinforcement learning, including exploration vs. exploitation, policy optimization, and value function approximation.
